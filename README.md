# MCP Security Registry

A community-driven registry of security evaluations for Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations.

## About This Project

The MCP Security Registry provides standardized security evaluations of MCP server implementations to help developers and organizations make informed decisions about which MCP servers to use in their applications.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). MCP servers act as intermediaries that manage context, handle retrieval, and facilitate communication between applications and LLMs.

### Why Security Matters

MCP servers often handle sensitive information and provide critical functionality for AI applications. Security vulnerabilities in MCP implementations can lead to data breaches, prompt injection attacks, and other security issues.

## Security Profiles

Browse security profiles by category:

- [Memory](profiles/memory/)
- [Retrieval](profiles/retrieval/)
- [Tool](profiles/tool/)
- [General Purpose](profiles/general/)

## Certification Levels

MCP implementations can receive one of three certification levels:

- **Bronze**: Meets basic security requirements
- **Silver**: Implements recommended security practices
- **Gold**: Follows security best practices with no critical/high vulnerabilities

See our [Evaluation Criteria](evaluation-criteria.md) for detailed information on certification requirements.

## Using This Registry

### For Developers

If you're building an application that uses an MCP server:

1. Browse the profiles to find implementations that meet your security requirements
2. Review the deployment recommendations for secure integration
3. Check the certification level and security scores

### For MCP Server Maintainers

If you maintain an MCP server implementation:

1. Review the evaluation criteria to understand security requirements
2. Self-assess your implementation using our tools
3. Address any security issues identified
4. Request an official evaluation by submitting an issue

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! See our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to contribute security evaluations and other improvements.

## Tools

This repository includes tools to help with security evaluations:

- [MCP Security Scanner](tools/mcp_security_scanner.py): Automated security scanner for MCP implementations
- [Profile Generator](tools/profile_generator.py): Generates profile templates from scan results
